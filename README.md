# CUHK & ETH & SIAT Solution to AcitivityNet Challenge 2016 

This repository holds the materials necessary to reproduce the results for our solution to ActivityNet Challenge 2016. 
We works on the untrimmed video classification task. 
Although initially designed for the challenge, the repository also means to provide an accessible framework for general video classification tasks.

*We are currently organizing the codebase. Please stay tuned.*

##Functionalities & Release Status

- [x] Basic utilities
- [ ] Action recognition with single video
    * [ ] Web demo for action recognition
- [ ] ActivityNet validation set evaluation
- [ ] Training action recognition system

##Dependencies
The codebase is written in Python. It is recommended to use [Anaconda][anaconda] distribution package with it.
Besides, we also use Caffe and OpenCV. 
Particularly, the OpenCV should be compiled with VideoIO support. GPU support will be good if possible.
